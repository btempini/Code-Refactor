## Homework 01

This is the first homework assignment and the goal is to add accesibility features to a pre-existing codebase.

***

## User Story:

As a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

***

## Requirements:

* Change HTML to semantic (format and get rid of `<div>` tags)

* Organize and structure

* Add `<alt>` attributes to all images and icons

* Make sure all `<h>` tags are in sequential order

* Edit title

***

## Results:

* Added `Horiseon` title.

* Removed all `<div>` tags.

* Added semantic HTML elements `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.

* Added `<alt>` attributes for all images and icons.

* Removed `<div>` background image and changed to `<img>` in HTML in order to create an `<alt>` attribute for that image. Formatted CSS accordingly by adding a `display: block` to keep the same look.

* Changed the last `<h2>` element to `<h4>` under `footer` to ensure all headings fall in sequential order, edited CSS accordingly by changing `font-size` to `20px` to keep the same look.

* Organized and structured HTML in a logical format.

* Added comments to CSS.
